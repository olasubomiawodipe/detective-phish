### Detective Phish

- A web extension dedicated for detecting phishing in emails.
- Goal is to get it to work on both Gmail and Outlook (starting with Gmail first).
- Working on frontend currently
- Should be able to read emails and return the following in a json file:
  - sender email address
  - content of the email
  - clickable links
- This is simply so the data can be passed through the backend where it will go through analysis to return a final phishing score
- Design will be done later
- Main focus now is to return the json file
